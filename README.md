# Coordinates-Saver-Plugin
A Minecraft Java plugin for servers in which players can save, recall, and remove coordinates from a list reachable by multiple commands.  I made this because I was too lazy to search through my file of screenshots to find one set of coordinates.

USAGE:
/seecoords [.CoordinatesName]: Used to bring up a list of saved coordinates (Optional: You can put in the name of the coordinates you saved as a parameter to search through the list for it.)
/savecoords [CoordinatesName, .x, .y, .z]: Used to save coordinates to a list. (Optional:  If you don't put in any x, y, or z coordinate as a parameter, the plugin will save your current coordinates.)
/removecoords [CoordinatesName]:  Will remove the coordinates specified by the parameter (Note: The parameter is not case sensitive).

. = optional

NOTE: The name of the saved coordinates cannot have any spaces in it, but dashes and underscores can work in place of spaces.
